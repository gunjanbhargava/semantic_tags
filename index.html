              <h2><b>M.TECH PROJECT </b></h2>
              <p>Network resources are finite and must be shared among available contenders; this inevitably causes contention for resources. Hence Contention Resolution schemes are key determinant in determining the network performance i.e. Packet Loss Probability and Delay.   The project has been implemented in MATLAB with multiple variants of Reflection Routing and Deflection Routing (Contention Resolution Schemes). In Reflection Routing scheme packet experiencing contention, is routed to an adjacent node. Thus efficiency (in terms of Packet Loss Probability and Delay) of Reflection routing depends on port selection scheme. In Deflection Routing packet experiencing contention, is diverted to other available paths to the destination. The effectiveness of Deflection Routing is dependent upon the number of alternatives paths available to the destination.  </p>
